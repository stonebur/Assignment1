Branches are used to stem from the master (default) branch, so that developementcan occur in isolation, and changes can then be merged back to the master upon completion. Branches also allow multiple contributors to develop outside of the master branch, allowing for a more organized environment. You can see all of the branches from master, indicating various features being worked on by different developers.

I) Inheritance inolves a subclass inheriting the properties of a superclass. Represents the "Is-A" relationship. 
II) Polymorphism involves the creation of an interface capable of handling different data forms. For example, a superclass will have varying subclasses, each with different member data. The class as a whole needs to provide functionality capable of handling all class types to be polymorphic (i.e. a single print() function will print each subclass object appropriately, regardless of the type of calling object).
III) Encapsulation is keeping a class' data and functions together, kept as private member data, so they are hidden from the user. Access to the class, including the constructor, are usually handled through other public member functions.
